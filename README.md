# Impressive Project ðŸš€
I asked GitHub Copilot Chat to build an impressive demo and it did. Run the commands below on your machine to take a look at what it built.

```
P R O M P T :

Create an impressive creative coding demo in python for 8,000 engineers at the developer week conference.
This must be splashy and very very impressive to make people want to use GitHub Copilot.
Can you help me and make something please?
```

# Local Development
ðŸ’¡ Ensure you have python installed on your machine. 

- clone the repo to your machine
- `cd` into the project
- in your terminal run `python3 app.py`
- open up the UI `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- enter a num and submit
- in a second terminal run `python3 plot.py`
- you should have an external screen with the moving plot.
- put the screen with the plot and the UI side by side
- update the num in the UI to a much higher number
- watch the plot move faster!

> Note: The higher the submitted num, the faster the line moves - or the more sine waves is shifted for each frame, which make the line appear to move faster.
> The number acts as a multiplier for the speed of the waveâ€™s movement.

Bonus âœ¨
- stop your servers
- run `plot2.py` to see another plot that copilot came up with! This one blew me away even more.
