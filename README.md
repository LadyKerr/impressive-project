An impressive project built with GitHub Copilot Chat in 5 mins - DevWeek Main Stage Demo

# Local Development
💡 Ensure you have python installed on your machine. 

- clone the repo to your machine
- `cd` into the project
- in your terminal run `python3 app.py`
- open up the UI `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- enter a num and submit
- in a second terminal run `python3 plot.py`
- you should have an external screen with the moving plot.
- put the screen with the plot and the UI side by side
- update the num in the UI to a much higher number
- watch the plot move faster!

> Note: The higher the submitted num, the faster the line moves - or the more sine waves is shifted for each frame, which make the line appear to move faster.
> The number acts as a multiplier for the speed of the wave’s movement.
